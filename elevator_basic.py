"""
This program is a worker responsible for allways running and taking periodically requests from a flask server
It simulates an elevator going up and down
The elevator can open and close doors, wait for requests, update its status and remove entries from a queue
Moving between floors takes 3 seconds and stoping on a floor takes 5 seconds
